                <p>Joel was born in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico and takes great pride in his Boriqua heritage. Being in a military family meant Joel went to 8 different schools throughout his early life. After pit-stops in Ft. Campbell, Ft. Stewart, and Ft. Buchanan, Joel was able to attend Kenwood High School in Clarksville, Tennessee for all 4 years. It was at Kenwood that Joel found a passion for Robotics after his freshman year STEM teacher convinced him to give it a shot. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Joel has learned he truly learns best by doing. He is pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering at the 'Tute'. He is currently an Undergraduate Researcher for the MIT Therapeutic Technology Design and Development Lab. In his very little free time he can be found at the gym or spending time with his fraternity brothers.</p>
